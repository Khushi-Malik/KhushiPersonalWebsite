## Conference in Singapore 🇸🇬  
### Presenting at EAAI @ AAAI 2026, and my first solo trip

I started working on this research paper in the summer of 2025. At the time, I didn’t know where it would lead, I only knew that writing a paper is an intensive, often exhausting process, and that this was my **first time doing qualitative research**. The learning curve was steep. There was a lot of uncertainty, a lot of reading, and a lot of moments where I had to trust that things would eventually come together.

As the project progressed, something shifted. I slowly began to take ownership of the work. Patterns started to emerge in the data, gaps became clearer, and I could see meaningful directions for improvement instead of just scattered observations. Bringing a qualitative research project to completion as an undergraduate was challenging, but deeply rewarding.

When the paper was accepted to **EAAI at AAAI 2026**, it felt really good to see the work appreciated. I wasn’t doing anything dramatic when I found out, I was just sitting at my desk studying, but the moment stayed with me. It felt like a quiet confirmation that the months of effort had meant something.

### The research, in simple terms

The paper builds on prior work by my supervisor, Professor Lisa Zhang, which explored **why students are motivated to study machine learning**. Our question was slightly different: if motivation matters so much, do *machine learning textbooks*, especially their introductory chapters, actually align with what students care about?

Textbooks are a surprisingly underexplored medium in computer science and ML education. For a field growing as fast as ML, it felt important to ask whether the materials students first encounter reflect their real interests and motivations.

I cared about this topic personally. I am deeply interested in ML, but I also remember what it felt like to be a beginner, and in many ways, I still am one. Understanding whether the field and its learning resources truly resonate with students felt important, especially as ML becomes more central across disciplines.

The research process itself was difficult. This kind of study hasn’t been done much before, and qualitative analysis was new territory for me. I spent a long time reading and coding the introductions of ten different ML textbooks, which meant not only reading carefully, but also retaining, organizing, and making sense of a lot of information. One moment that really stood out was receiving recognition from my supervisor for my research methodology. Having her guidance throughout the process made a huge difference, and it helped me grow more confident in my work.

### My first-ever solo trip ✈️

January 2026 also marked my **first solo international trip**, which felt just as significant as the conference itself.

Before leaving, the logistics scared me the most, navigating airports, security, layovers, and figuring out how to get from the airport to the hotel all felt daunting. But surprisingly, I stayed calm the entire time. Even when my first flight was delayed by an hour and a half, with only a two-hour layover in Vancouver before my flight to Singapore, I didn’t panic. Things worked out more smoothly than I had imagined.

Singapore immediately felt safe and welcoming. Taking a taxi from the airport was straightforward, and even navigating public transportation turned out to be simple once I observed how locals did it. I was nervous right before taking my first bus to the conference venue, but that passed quickly.

Being alone felt more empowering than lonely. I explored the city late at night without fear, something I hadn’t expected. One thing I did notice, though, is that eating alone is still hard for me, I often lost my appetite at hotel breakfasts. That’s something I want to work on.

One of the highlights of the trip was meeting a PhD student from Berkeley, whom my professor introduced me to. We ended up sightseeing together and hit it off instantly, which made the experience even more special.

By the end of the trip, I felt genuinely empowered, like I can handle much more than I used to think.

### Presenting at EAAI @ AAAI 2026

Presenting my paper in person was one of the most fulfilling parts of the experience. I practiced a lot, so much that on the morning of my presentation, I woke up at 4 a.m. just to rehearse until it became muscle memory.

I could clearly see how much I had improved since my previous presentations. My legs shook less, my nerves were more controlled, and I handled questions with more confidence. My professor was really happy with my presentation (she even gave me a KitKat afterward), and I received a shoutout for leading the research as an undergraduate. That moment meant a lot to me.

After the presentation, people came up to talk to me. One person in particular stood out, someone with a literature background who was genuinely excited about textbook analysis. While I was presenting, I noticed him smiling the entire time, and that alone made me feel more comfortable and grounded.

That was a moment where I truly felt like I belonged in the research space.

### Experiencing Singapore 🇸🇬

Singapore itself was incredible. The city is so clean, disciplined, and full of energy. I explored until late at night without fear, and I didn’t have a single bad meal the entire trip.

We had limited time to explore after conference days ended at 6 p.m., but we made the most of it. One evening, we went to Little India for dinner and then walked to Gardens by the Bay. Another night, we explored Chinatown. My feet hurt from all the walking, but I never felt tired.

One small lesson I learned: always carry some cash when traveling. Not having cash was the only thing that stopped me from trying mango sticky rice, which I have to save for next time! That said, I did find the best mango sorbet I have ever had at a famous ice cream shop near our hotel. Over the weekend, the line was massive, but on Monday night it was completely empty, perfect timing.

### Looking back

Compared to summer 2025, I feel noticeably more confident. I am more comfortable with public speaking, more certain that research is where I want to be, and more convinced that graduate school is the right next step for me. This trip also taught me that I’m better at handling myself than I used to think.

If I could tell my past self one thing, it would be this: *you are more capable than you think, trust the process.*

I am excited to keep doing research, to keep traveling, and to keep growing. And yes, one of my 2026 goals is learning how to enjoy eating alone without losing my appetite 💀
