Every year on the 1st of January, my family sits down to reflect and plan. We discuss the highlights and moments from the past year, both good and bad, and then talk openly about what we want for the coming year. We share our resolutions and look back at what we accomplished from the previous year, very transparently.


This first of January was no different. This year, with my first blog, I want to talk about my resolutions and voice them throughout the year so that I can track the progress I make on the big ones. This blog is the first step toward a larger goal: losing my inhibitions and not underestimating myself as I grow. I want to write a blog every week. Sometimes it may just be a small paragraph, and sometimes it may be longer, as my mind often has a lot to think about. But every week, I will write something.


I wanted to start with a rundown of 2025. The year brought with it a lot of growth.


On a professional level, I took steps that I would not have imagined taking in previous years. I took courses on my own downtown Toronto this semester, something I would not have imagined doing in 2024. I went on my first trip without my parents to present my research at ICER in Virginia and received a lot of acclaim for it. I applied to universities for a Master’s/PhD. I won my first hackathon award. I made my first LinkedIn post. I had two papers published. I earned my AWS certification. I attended a talk by Geoffrey Hinton. I built my own website and got a volunteer position with an archaeology lab.


On a more personal level, I changed in ways that matter just as much. Looking back at my 20-year-old self from last year, I can see that I am now much more comfortable being alone and in my own skin. I became more travel-independent and started spending more time downtown on my own. I made many new friends and became a bit distant from a few others. I also started becoming more balanced in my life, giving myself room for error, allowing myself to breathe, and enjoying time with my family instead of being so consumed by work that I forgot everything else. This is still a work in progress, but I do see myself improving. I celebrated my birthday properly after two years and turned 21.


There were also many family highlights, including my mom’s admission and us going out more, whether locally or even traveling to Montreal. We also got to go to India for two weeks after a long time and meet family I had missed dearly.


However, alongside all the good, there were many areas where I did not meet my own expectations. I wanted to write a personal diary every Sunday, but I failed to write even one entry. I wanted to read about cybersecurity every Sunday, but failed to do so. I left many learning opportunities/projects half-finished and did not read as much as I wanted to. I also struggled to make time for my goals outside of school, including both technical and non-technical books I had hoped to read.


The coming year feels like a turning point. I will soon finish my university credits and find myself at a place where I have to make more intentional choices about direction, what I want to pursue, what I want to let go of, and what kind of work I want to grow into. January already marks a first step in that shift, as I will be taking my first solo conference trip, traveling from Toronto to Singapore to present my research independently in front of AI professors and researchers from around the world. It feels both exciting and unnerving, and maybe that is exactly how it should feel.


More than anything, 2026 feels like a year of showing up more honestly for myself. This blog is part of that. It is a way to slow down, reflect, and hold myself accountable without being harsh. The things I struggled with last year, consistency, follow-through, focussing on crossing  the finish line, making space for learning outside of deadlines, are not failures I want to carry forward, but lessons I want to work with more deliberately.


By the end of this year, I do not want perfection or certainty. However, I want to be able to look back and say that I tried my best and that I seized every opportunity to grow without constantly doubting my place. With every post here, I want to mark that process, one weekly highlight, one thing to improve, and an honest snapshot of where I am at that moment.
